# Destiny Oracle
A work-in-progress archival site used to store data about Destiny 2.

Models are from Destiny 2's game files, using a highly complex reconstruction of the images, skeletons, positioning data, etc. to generate .fbx and .glb versions as showcased. Direct downloads of assets in a test format are provided.

The cubemaps are taken directly from Destiny 2, with some of the visual artifacting caused by BC7 to PNG conversion. The images are used in the game primarily for reflections, but can sometimes provide insight by providing in-dev or alternate-angle images. Also it's just cool.

## Licensing

The cubemaps and models are owned by Bungie and hence must not be used commercially. Please cite this work or myself if these are used for more non-commercial work.
